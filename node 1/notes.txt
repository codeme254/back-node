node releases
even numbered versions of node currently are or will eventually become an LTS version

odd numbered versions will only be current versions. they will never have the stability that lts versions give us
each lts version is seperated into an active phase and a maintainance phase, when active most changes are accepted as long as they don't break existing codes.
go with even numbered of versions if you will deploy your app in a few.
